Preface:
========
Before trying to perform mutation testing, all the failed and Exception throwing test cases are temporarily mutated using a special annotation SkipTest.
Those failing/crashing test cases due to bugs that need to be addressed. I disabled those from mutation testing just to reduce noise from the existing
bugs while testing.

Mutation Operator:
==================
Mutation is generated manually by replacing some binary relational operator with other possible operators.

To view mutants:
===============
The project files are checked in as git repository and all the mutants exist as branch. You need to have git-scm installed to see history or see any brach.

To checkout any mutant, just run from the command line:
git checkout mutant-d[d]

For example, to see mutant-5 you need to issue "git checkout mutant-5",
and to see mutant-15 you need to issue "git checkout mutant-15"

Description of the mutants:
===========================
All the mutants are described below. First line describes the Filename, line number, and the change made to generate the mutant. The second line says
whether the mutant is killed or not by the test cases. If killed, the number of failed (functional test) and crashed (among all tests) test numbers are
also given. If not killed (all test case passed and no crash), I also described the reason why the mutant is indistinguishable by any test input. For all
the following mutants, I did not come across any situation where I can improve my test cases to kill the mutant.


Mutant-1
  BNDM.java: 113 - changed relational operator from ">=" to ">"
  Killed (12 failed)

Mutant-2
  BNDM.java: 113 - changed relational operator from ">=" to "=="
  Killed (8 failed)

Mutant-3
  BNDM.java: 113 - changed relational operator from ">=" to "<"
  Killed (12 failed)

Mutant-4
  BNDM.java: 113 - changed relational operator from ">=" to "<="
  Killed (8 failed, 4 crashed)

Mutant-5
  BNDM.java: 113 - changed relational operator from ">=" to "!="
  Killed (12 failed)

Mutant-6
  BNDM.java: 167 - changed relational operator from "<=" to "<"
  Killed (36 failed)
 
Mutant-7
  BNDM.java: 167 - changed relational operator from "<=" to "=="
  Killed (88 failed)

Mutant-8
  BNDM.java: 167 - changed relational operator from "<=" to ">"
  Killed (115 failed, 18 crashed)

Mutant-9
  BNDM.java: 167 - changed relational operator from "<=" to ">="
  Killed (88 failed, 18 crashed)

Mutant-10
  BNDM.java: 167 - changed relational operator from "<=" to "!="
  Killed (36 failed, 19 crashed)

Mutant-11
  BNDM.java: 171 - changed relational operator from "!=" to "=="
  Killed (115 failed)

Mutant-12
  BNDM.java: 171 - changed relational operator from "!=" to ">"
  Killed (115 failed)

Mutant-13
  BNDM.java: 171 - changed relational operator from "!=" to ">="
  Killed (115 failed)

Mutant-14
  BNDM.java: 171 - changed relational operator from "!=" to "<"
  Killed (79 failed)

Mutant-15
  BNDM.java: 171 - changed relational operator from "!=" to "<="
  Killed (38 failed, 58 crashed)

Mutant-16
  BNDMWildcardsCI.java: 138 - changed relational operator from "<" to "=="
  Killed (10 failed)

Mutant-17
  BNDMWildcardsCI.java: 138 - changed relational operator from "<" to "!="
  Killed (44 crashed)

Mutant-18
  BNDMWildcardsCI.java: 138 - changed relational operator from "<" to "<="
  Not Killed!

  Reason:
  This mutant is an equivalent mutant. Though the mutants meets Reachability and Necessity, it does not support sufficiency.

  Explanation:
  The purpose of the mutated statement is to determine the lowest. If any any lower value found, assign the new one as the minimum.
  Replacing "<" operator with "<=" makes some more unnecessary assignment (when those are equal), but has no impact on the output.

Mutant-19
  BNDMWildcardsCI.java: 138 - changed relational operator from "<" to ">"
  Killed (6 failed, 44 crashed)

Mutant-20
  BNDMWildcardsCI.java: 138 - changed relational operator from "<" to ">="
  Killed (5 failed, 44 crashed)
